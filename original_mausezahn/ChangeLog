version 0.40
============
2010-07-07

Important bugfixes and some interesting new features:

- Configured packets can now be grouped to 'packet sequences', optionally with
  additional delays between each packet chain. Use the 'sequence' command to
  enter the sequence configuration mode. Only in interactive mode.
- IP auto-fragmentation is now supported in interactive mode. For every IP-based
  packet you can configure a 'fragment-size' and optionally a 'fragment-
  overlap'. 
- Direct mode, jitter measurements: Now uses consistently the ssrc option to
  distinguish different RTP streams. 
- Corrected PVST+ spanning tree packets in both direct and interactive mode
  (and exhaustively tested). 
- Direct mode: Loose Source Route option works now correctly (tested it in
  Cisco network).
- Interactice mode: 'start' command has been renamed to 'run'. Also improved 
  packet selection with this command, using IDs or names. Also sequences can
  be started that way.
- Lots of bugfixes, more and less critical.



version 0.39
============
2010-03-07

This is basically a stable version with a few more features. Everybody should
use only this version and not one of the previous!

- Fixed 100% CPU-consumption bug, occurring when Mausezahn is used in
  interactive mode or RTP-measurement mode and the system has a recent
  libpcap-dev library.
- Added RTP support in MOPS.
- Improved RTP measurement mode (more efficient, some bugs fixed, internally
  nanosecond resolution for future and hi-end machines).
- Fixed sporadic clean-up bugs (NULL-pointer verification).
- Updated man pages.


version 0.38
============
2009-12-24

Mausezahn now supports a multi-threaded mode with Cisco-style command line. 
Try e. g. "mz -x 99" and telnet to port 99. This mode utilizes a new protocol
and packet management framework called MOPS (Mausezahn's Own Packet System).
From now on all new features are added to MOPS. 

This is a X-mas release and should be considered beta (although the legacy
part should be much more stable and cleaner than the version 0.34.9 and the
new MOPS part has been already tested somewhat...). PLEASE send be bug
reports! 

Known bugs:

Due to a libpcap-problem (I assume) Mausezahn runs quite unstable
under Ubuntu 9.10 (100% CPU consumption in MOPS mode, segfaults upon
termination, unbounded numbers in jitter measurement mode...). Interestingly
no problems when running under Debian 5.0 or Ubuntu 8.04. 

Changelog: (only the most important)

- Added basic support for IGMP (v1, v2), querier and client mode (currently
  only TX, no RX). (MOPS)
- Added basic LLDP support (MOPS). Also supports 'bad' TLV creation.
- Multi-device support (MOPS).
- Support for nanosecond inter-packet delays (MOPS). The CLI now allows to 
  configure inter-packet delay in units hour, min, sec, msec, usec, and nsec.
- Support for greater transmission intervals.
- FIXED simulation mode; -V is now only the extended verbose mode and the new
  switch -S enables the simulation mode (i. e. nothing is sent).
- Support for automatic L2-multicast addresses when L3 address is multicast
  (MOPS).
- Added 'launch' commands for easier handling of usual tasks. (Currently only
  synflood and BPDU).
- Added ARP observation service; this can be also used to detect malicious ARP
  tricks on the LAN, e. g. ARP cache poisoning attacks.
- Improved IP range configuration in legacy code.
- Support for independent measurements of concurrent RTP streams (as part
  of legacy code). Now each RTP stream can be assigned an arbitrary ID.
  This solution is easier to handle (than IP-based) an NAT-independent.
- Added -r option for randomized interpacket delay.
- Prettier rtp measurement outputs via 'bar' (default) and 'txt' commands.
- More precise RTP jitter measurements now.
- Added 'bar' and 'txt' option for rtp jitter measurements.
- Migrated BPDU to mops.
- The -t option (protocol type) is now case insensitive for subsequent
  protocol commands. 
- Support for central mausezahn configuration file (/etc/mausezahn/mz.cfg)
  containing username, password, enable, etc. In case the config file is
  not present Mausezahn uses default credentials (user: mz, password: mz,
  enable: mops).
- Better cleanup when aborting; fixed clean_up function to also clean-up 
  mops list
- Legacy code: Protocol command string is now case insensitive.
- Fixed str2hex function (potential stack smashing threat)




version 0.37
============
(not officially released)

- Command 'clear all' now removes all packets except a plain init packet
- Added command 'clear packet' to remove a specific packet
- Added command 'reset packet' to re-initialize all data of a MOPS entry
- Changed mops id to u_int32_t
- Added 'load' command to load and run a config file 
- Added 'launch' command to easily start predefined packet processes
- #defined MZ_DEFAULT_CONFIG_PATH "/etc/mausezahn/" which is now the default 
  location for the global config file (with passwords and other things)
- #defined MZ_DEFAULT_LOG_PATH "/var/log/mausezahn/" which is now the default
  location for any dynamically created files such as logs and packet captures. 
- Fixed limits check for strtoul and strtoull in str2int (etc) in tools.c.


version 0.36
============
(not officially released)

- Added lots of new commands compared with version 0.35. (Too much to list here)
- Changed MOPS architecture from array to doubly linked list. (Code release
  'Cyanistes caeruleus' - all mops versions will be named after cute birds)
- Multi-threaded packet generation.
- Added full support for 802.1Q and MPLS (arbitrary number of tags)
- Migrated ARP, IP (no options), UDP, and TCP (stateless) to MOPS
  

version 0.35 
============
(not officially released)

- Added interactive (Cisco-style) commandline interface: Start Mausezahn with
  the -x option (optionally specify port number, default is 25542) and then
  Mausezahn accepts incoming Telnet connections. Currently this CLI should be
  considered experimental.
- Allow arbitrary (user-defined) variable fields within frames (multi-precision
  counters).
- Fixed automatic device detection bugs if vmware interfaces are present. Also
  a bug that prevents choosing the loopback interface on some systems has been
  fixed.
- Ascii payloads can now be specified in a file which is specified by the new
  option-f <filename>.
- Hexadecimal payloads can no be specified in a file which is specified by the
  new option -F <filename>.
- To improve usage consistency, added 'help' argument also for the 802.1Q
  option, that is, also  '-Q help' is now possible (as with many other options). 



version 0.34.7
==============
2009-07-27

- RTP packet drop count and disorder count (the number of permutations
  needed to regain the correct sequence) are not only printed on the 
  CLI but also in the 9th and 10th columns of the log file.
- Added RTP jitter estimation as specified in RFC3550 (smoothed mean deviation). 
  This value is printed on the CLI and in the 5th column of the rtp log-file.
- Fixed -V option with raw layer-2 frames (simulation mode).
- Fixed padding (-p) option (segfault when number too big)
- Fixed some potential stack overflow issues (thanks Vivek!)


version 0.34.6
==============
2008-12-10

- Added the IP arguments df (don't fragment), mf (more fragments), and rf
  (reserved flag). This makes it easier to build fragmented packets.
  

version 0.34.5
==============
2008-10-30

- Added RTP packet drop count and disorder count (the number of permutations
  needed to regain the correct sequence). These values are printed on the 
  CLI.
- Fixed usage of ranges even when no payload is specified; previously Mausezahn
  had problems with that; error messages include:
   a)  mz/update_DPORT: Can't build TCP header: libnet_build_tcp(): payload
       inconsistency
   b)  mz/update_IP_DA: IP address manipulation failed!
  or similar.
- Updated the INSTALL file.



version 0.34.1
==============
2008-10-08

- Mausezahn now checks system clock precision and chooses monotonic nanosecond
  clock if available or alternative clock otherwise. No nasty warning message 
  should occur anymore.



version 0.34
============
2008-09-24

- Replaced gettimeofday() with the clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC) which does
  not jump when the system syncs via NTP (otherwise artefacts would occur in
  long-term jitter-measurement data; additionally nanosecond precision is 
  (internally) supported, although it is not really required).
- Added IP options 'Loose Source Route' and 'Strict Source Route', as well as
  the possibility to specify any IP option as hexadecimal string.
- IP packets can now be sent without any payload (previously at least a single
  payload byte has been added)
- Added -V option (extended verbose) which prints only frame details but does
  not put anything on the wire.
- Added icmp option echo request (ping), echo reply (default), and unreachable.
  Also made some clean-ups here.


version 0.33.2
==============
2008-09-11

- RTP packets are now (at least more) standard conform. Now Mausezahn per
  default simulates a G.711 codec with 20 msec inter-packet delay and 160 bytes 
  payload. The usage of the timestamps should be correct now so that other
  applications can also interprete Mausezahn's RTP header.
- Added 8 byte padding to BPDU packets (some switches rejected the packet; now
  whole frame is always 60 bytes long (added 8 zero bytes or 4 for PVST+,
  respectively).
- Fixed PVST+ packet format. Should be correct now; can be sent with (default)
  or without 802.1Q tag.
- Better help text for BPDU mode.
- Added 'pvst' as additional keyword for specification of MAC addresses


version 0.33.1
==============
2008-09-04

- Upon startup Mausezahn checks if it has root privileges (getuid, geteuid)
- 'Cleaned' the files README, INSTALL, and AUTHORS, fixed some missing information
  and applied a line wrap at 80 chars to comply with packaging requirements.
- Also made a 80-char line-wrap in the source code's license statement.


version 0.33 
============
2008-08-20

- Clearly defined GPLv2 as license.
- Support for the Syslog protocol.
- Inclusion of cmake for easier build process.
- Some minor bugfixes, e. g. now "mz -t help" works (before you had to enter 
  "mz eth0 -t help").

Thanks to Cristian Greco, Steve Grubb, Rauno Tuul, and Heinz Wiesinger for help
and feedback.




================================================================================

Since I was too lazy to maintain a changelog before version 0.32 let
me summarize at least all features and possible bugs at this point:

*) Full support for the following protocols:

    - ARP
    - BPDU (PVST+)
    - CDP
    - UDP
    - TCP (only transmission, no state machine so far)
    - DNS 
    
*) Limited support:

    - ICMP (started to implement ICMP redirects, did not had time for
            tests so far; almost sure buggy)
	    
    - RTP  (only needed for jitter measurements, the timestamps used
            are quite proprietary (sec and msec separately))

*) Other features

    - can send arbitrary byte sequences longer or equal 15 bytes
    - randomized MAC and/or IP addresses
    - ranges for IP addresses, port numbers, TCP sequence numbers
    - 802.1Q VLAN tags (arbitrary depth) plus CoS values
    - MPLS tags (arbitrary depth) plus CoS and TTL values
    - automatic padding if desired
    - inter-packet delays in usec (but can also be specified in msec
      and sec)
    - text or hex payloads 
    - RTP receiving mode to measure jitter with high precision (usec
      is base, plan to measure true precision empirically, I guess
      it is at least below 1 msec)

*) Possible bugs

    - Limited checks for wrong arguments and options (however, I
      tried to avoid buffer overflows, mostly)
      
    - ICMP packets (redirects) may be incorrect (I had no use for
      those so far)
