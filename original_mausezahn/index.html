    <p><b>2010-07-07</b> Released <a href="mz-0.40.tar.gz">mz-0.40</a>:
    New features including configurable packet sequences, IP fragmentation
    (also with overlaps), better PVST+ and IP loose source routing, lots of
    bugfixes, etc.  See the <a href="ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a>.</p>

    <p><b>2010-03-07</b> Released <a href="mz-0.39.tar.gz">mz-0.39</a>: Fixed
    the nasty CPU-consumption bug that occurred on systems with the latest
    libpcap-dev, improved jitter measurement, updated documentation. Everybody
    should upgrade to this release for security and stability reasons!
    See the <a href="ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a> for more information about this
    and the previous releases.</p>

    <p><b>2009-12-24</b> Released <b>mz-0.38</b>
    which is a major release; probably 'Mausezahn next-generation'. It is now
    multi-threaded and provides a Cisco-style command line. Other features
    include improved jitter measurements, and the new MOPS-part supports nanosecond 
    inter-packet delay, IGMP (v1, v2), LLDP, and ARP monitoring. 
    The quick old style operation is still supported and has also been improved.
    This is a X-mas release; I will still be busy the next weeks and months so
    expect many additional features soon.
    </p>

    <p><b>2009-08-06</b> Released <b>mz-0.34.9</b> -
    which fixed some problems during the build process on different platforms.
    </p>


    <p><b>2009-07-29</b> Released mz-0.34.8 - Only
    a small 'cosmetic' update to enhance the build process with safety checks.
    </p>


    <p><b>2009-07-27</b> Released <b>mz-0.34.7 - A security bugfix</b>
    with some additional features: RTP packet drop count, disorder count (the number of permutations
    needed to regain the correct sequence) now also written in log files, 
    and RTP jitter estimation as specified in RFC3550 (smoothed mean deviation). 
    
    This is NOT the promised summer update (which will come in August) but
    only a small update of the 'legacy code'. 
    </p>

    <p><b>2008-12-10</b> Released <b>mz-0.34.6</b> which supports easier creation
    of fragmented IP packets (the flags df, mf, and rf can be set
    more easily).</p>
   
    <p><b>2008-10-30</b> Released <b>mz-0.34.5</b> which includes one important
    bugfix and also supports measuring the degree of out-of-order
    RTP packets as well as dropped RTP packets.</p>

    <p><b>2008-10-26</b> FYI: just to inform you that I am not
    lazy, the next Mausezahn release (0.35) is coming soon. Lots of
    new features and fixes will be included!</p>

    <p><b>2008-10-07</b> I've got some reports that v0.34 has some
    problems with the high precision timer on some systems. I
    immediately fixed that in <b>mz-0.34.1</b> which automatically determines
    which timer is the most usable on your system. See also the
    <a href="#download">download</a> section below.</p>

    <p><b>2008-09-24</b> Version 0.34, improved timer for jitter
    measurement, IP source route options, and ICMP improvements.
    See also the changelog.</p>

    <p><b>2008-09-11</b> Version 0.33.2, fixed bugs with BPDUs,
    PVST+, and RTP. Got reports that some Cisco switches do not
    accept Mausezahn's CDP packets anymore...even Wireshark
    recognizes a bad checksum in the <em>original</em> CDP packets
    (while Mausezahn's checksum is OK)...does anybody know what's
    going on there? I will focus on that...</p>

    <p><b>2008-09-04</b> Version 0.33.1, minor fixes.</p>

    <p><b>2008-08-20</b> Version 0.33 out now! Now an cmake-based
    build mechanism is included, support for the Syslog protocol,
    minor bugfixes, and most importantly, the license is now
    clearly defined: GPLv2.</p>

	<h2><a name="what" id="what">What is Mausezahn?</a></h2>

    <p>Mausezahn is a free fast traffic generator written in C
    which allows you to send nearly every possible and impossible
    packet. It is mainly used to test VoIP or multicast networks
    but also for security audits to check whether your systems are
    hardened enough for specific attacks.</p>Mausezahn can be used
    for example:

    <ul>
      <li>As <b>traffic generator</b> (e. g. to stress multicast
      networks)</li>

      <li>To precisely measure <b>jitter</b> (delay variations)
      between two hosts (e. g. for VoIP-SLA verification)</li>

      <li>As <b>didactical</b> tool during a datacom lecture or for
      lab exercises</li>

      <li>For <b>penetration testing</b> of firewalls and IDS</li>

      <li>For DoS attacks on networks (for audit purposes of
      course)</li>

      <li>To find bugs in network software or appliances</li>

      <li>For reconnaissance attacks using ping sweeps and port
      scans</li>

      <li>To test network behaviour under strange circumstances
      (stress test, malformed packets, ...)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>...and more. Mausezahn is basically a versatile packet
    creation tool on the command line with a simple syntax and
    context help. It could also be used within (bash-) scripts to
    perform combination of tests. By the way, Mausezahn is quite
    fast; when started on my old PIII-Laptop (1.4 GHz, Gigabit
    Ethernet) I measured <b>755 Mbit/s</b> using the interface
    packet counters of an HP ProCurve 5400 switch.</p>

    <p>Currently Mausezahn is only available for Linux platforms.
    <b>Please</b> <b>do NOT PORT Mausezahn to Windows!</b>
    (<a href="http://www.fefe.de/nowindows/">Here is a nice explanation
    why</a>; I really share Felix von Leitner's point of view.)
    </p>

    <h2><a name="how" id="how">Quick Introduction</a></h2>

    <p>As of version 0.38, Mausezahn supports the following
    protocols:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>ARP</li>

      <li>BPDU or PVST</li>

      <li>CDP</li>
      
      <li>LLDP</li>

      <li>IP</li>

      <li>IGMP</li>

      <li>UDP</li>

      <li>TCP (stateless)</li>

      <li>ICMP (partly)</li>

      <li>DNS</li>

      <li>RTP optionally RX-mode for jitter measurements</li>

      <li>Syslog</li>
    </ul>

    <p>All packets can be VLAN-tagged and/or include an MPLS label
    stack (both in arbitrary depth). Furthermore, all header
    parameters are easily accessible, many of them support ranges,
    and even invalid settings are possible. By default the most
    appropriate header parameters are chosen.</p>

    <p>Let me give you a quick example to demonstrate how simple it
    is to work with Mausezahn.</p>

    <p>&#9654; Send an <b>arbitrary sequence of bytes</b> through
    your network card 1000 times:</p>
    <pre id="code">
# mz eth0 -c 1000 \
"ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff cc:dd 00:00:00:ca:fe:ba:be"
</pre>Note that this 'frame' is (by intention) completely invalid
with respect to the Ethernet standard; the frame is too short
(called a 'runt') and has a broadcast source address.

    <p>&#9654; But you can send more complex packets easily with
    the built-in packet builders using the <b>-t</b> option. Let's
    send a <b>forged DNS response</b> to host 192.168.1.2 by
    impersonating the DNS server 10.7.7.42:</p>
    <pre id="code">
# mz eth0  -A 10.7.7.42 -B 192.168.1.2 \
-t dns "q=www.thehostyouseek.com, a=172.16.6.66"
</pre>Of course you can manipulate much more in the DNS header,
simply type <b>mz -t dns help</b> for additional help.

    <p>&#9654; Perform a <b>TCP SYN-Flood</b> attack against all
    hosts in subnet 10.5.5.0/24 which are in VLAN 100. Try out all
    1023 well-known ports. Provided that you are in the native VLAN
    50 you can reach the target via <b>VLAN-hopping</b>. Repeat the
    whole attack endlessly by setting the count option to zero:</p>
    <pre id="code">
# mz eth0 -c 0 -Q 50,100 -A rand -B 10.5.5.0/25 \
-t tcp "flags=syn, dp=1-1023"
</pre>

    <p>&#9654; <b>Confuse the spanning tree:</b> Behave like a root
    bridge and generate BPDUs with lowest Bridge ID every two
    seconds:</p>
    <pre id="code">
# mz eth0 -c 0 -d 2s -t bpdu 
</pre>As you see you don't even need to specify any other BPDU
parameters because Mausezahn assumes that your PC wants to be the
root per default. Of course you can modify every BPDU parameter.
Event the Cisco-proprietary per-vlan spanning tree <b>PVST+</b> is
supported:
    <pre id="code">
# mz eth0 -c 0 -d 2s -t bpdu vlan=314
</pre>

    <p>&#9654; Voice over IP connections suffer from <b>jitter</b>
    (delay variations). Hence it is important to know the jitter
    across a given path. Using Mausezahn you can precisely measure
    the jitter continuously. Simply configure a Mausezahn sender
    and a receiver:</p>
    <pre id="code">
TX# mz eth0 -t rtp -B rx.somewhere.net
RX# mz eth0 -T rtp "log, path=/tmp"
</pre>Using these settings, the sender (TX) sends RTP packets every
20 msec to the specified receiver (RX). Station RX stores moving
average data in /tmp/rtp_avg_20080801-120233 (filename is current
timestamp). The data is a comma seperated list that can be easily
analyzed and visualized with standard tools, e. g. R, Matlab,
Octave, or <a href="viewrtp.tgz">this python tool</a> (which needs
the matplotlib). An example output is seen below, I only measured
the jitter across a local gigabit link. <img src="localjitter.png" width="600" height="404" alt="JAWS">

    <p>&#9654; <b>Real-time jitter monitoring</b> As with version
    0.38, Mausezahn supports two nicer displays of the jitter measurements.
    The default is 'bar':
    </p><img src="mz_jitter.png" width="639" height="837" alt="JAWS" border="1">

    <p>...the other is 'txt':</p>
    <img src="mz_jitter1.png" width="574" height="709" alt="JAWS" border="1">
    
    <p>&#9654; <b>Interactive and multi-threaded mode</b> As with version
    0.38, Mausezahn alternatively provides an interactive mode with Cisco-style
    command line. To try out, start Mausezahn e. g. with</p>

    <pre id="code">
# mz  -x 99
    </pre>

    <p>and open a telnet connection to port 99 from another terminal or
       computer. Here are some impressions:</p>

    <p>Since Mausezahn is open source (and now part of Debian SID
    and other Linux distributions) I only provide tar balls
    here. In order to build the binary you need the <em>cmake</em>
    package, as well as actual versions of <em>libnet</em> and
    <em>libpcap</em>. See the INSTALL instructions in the
    Mausezahn package.</p>

    <h2><a name="bugs" id="bugs">Bugs and Feedback</a></h2>

    <p>Please tell me about your experience with Mausezahn, which
    features you miss, and which bugs you have found.</p>

    <p>Dear developers: Currently Mausezahn is undergoing
    significant architectural changes and cleanups - therefore you
    should <em>not</em> add your own code to it because it will be incompatible
    later. For now it is better you tell me your desired features
    and I will put them on the (continuously growing) wishlist.</p>

    <p>You can reach me via <em>herbertXXXperihel.at</em> (replace
    the XXX with one @ symbol) and please mention "MAUSEZAHN" in
    the subject line.</p>

    <p>Before you send me a bug report please look at the <a href="ChangeLog">changelog</a>.</p><br>
